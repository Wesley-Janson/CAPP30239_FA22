# COVID-relevant Data
* This data allows for a further exploration into what *** duringCOVID-19. While once again there is a 
plethora of information that is relevant, I decide on finding the 10 components that have the highest 
average weight from February 2020 to present, and create an index (Feb 2020=100) to observe how the 
comparatively important goods and services have changed in relative price since February 2020, right
before COVID became a worldwide epidemic.
