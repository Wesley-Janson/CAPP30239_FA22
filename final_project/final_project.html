    <h1>Which Goods and Services Drove Inflation During COVID-19?</h1>
    <h2>A peak into PCE inflation goods and services during the pandemic</h2>
    <p>
      The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic threw our way of life into a panic. The manner in which we lived seemingly changed 
      overnight. The mass closures for the good of public health lead to a short, but deep recession, one of the largest shocks to our economy 
      in history led to price pressures that have not been seen in decades. Inflation went from a topic only discussed by academics 
      and policymakers to being on the forefront of public debate. Consumers now find themselves painfully aware of inflation. 
      A fair question to ask would be "which of the goods and services have been driving the high levels of inflation"? This project aims to shed 
      a little light on that quesiton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a step back-what is inflation? Why is this question important to us? Inflation can be characterized as the general increase in the overall price level 
      of the goods and services in the economy (cite). It's importance to our day-to-day lives cannot be understated. Inflation affects the purchasing power that people have 
      first and foremost, but also has been shown to be a key indicator in both expected and realized economic performance. Specific to this project, the 
      measure of inflation I use is the Bureau of Economic Analysis' (BEA) Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE). This is the measure targeted 
      by the Federal Reserve in the United States, and is "A measure of the prices that people living in the United States, or those buying on their behalf, 
      pay for goods and services" (cite). PCE uses 201 goods and services to approximate the general change in price level for consumers. Each month, a representative 
      sample of consumers are surveyed about what they purchase, both the price and quantity. The BEA then tabulates each goods price and quantity for consumers. 
      To compute the reported "headline" inflation rate, the expenditure weighted average (as determined by the quantities) of the price changes is computed. Similarly,
      different baskets can be computed ("core" inflation is a commonly reported one-all goods less energy and food items). These aggregate metrics can be a good indicator
      of the general trend in prices, but may obfiscate underlying trends in specific goods.

    <h3>Look into Price Change Distribution</h3>

    <p>
      Among all the goods and services that are used to compute PCE inflation, we see price changes vary widely during the COVID-19 period.
      It is noteworthy that the very bottom and top of the distribution are considerably distant from the average and median percent change 
      in prices. Everything in the IQR (25th to 75th percentiles) is relatively clustered, and consistent.

    <h3>How much did some of the most volatile components change during COVID-19?</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      The charts above look at five of the most volatile goods and services in terms of monthly price changes in the PCE price index during the COVID-19 period. 
      This illustrates just how extreme the largest deviation from February 2020 price levels were (marked "Max Deviation"), and what the current price is in 
      relation to the pre-COVID period ("Current"). Although each of these goods are the most volatile in terms of price changes, the nature of those changes are 
      quite different. Gasoline, and other fuel/oil behaved in a predictable pattern. Peaking in price during 2021 only to come down, but not to pre-COVID levels. Film/photo supplies
      and primary school lunches took a different shape, however. The pandemic caused a rapid decrease in prices for consumers for both goods 
      (the school lunches have an intuitive answer as to why, many free-lunch programs were instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, causing
      consumer spending on school lunches to drop).

    <h3>COVID-19 led to massive price swings</h3>

      This variable area chart shows the 10 highest weighted goods on average during the COVID-19 period. The thickness of the line denotes the weighted-price
      index for the good, with the lines towards the top denoting the goods with the higher index value (February 2020=100). It can be seen that the initial 
      wave of COVID-19 (2020) led to rapid swings in the prices of these goods. However, by mid-2021, the change in the price indices smoothed out, although 
      many at the top (energy goods in particular) have continued to grow in their index value, which can be seen by the growing width of the top few lines. 
    </p>
    <h3>Data Process</h3>
    <p>
      The process for gathering the relevant price and weights data was a relatively simple one. The raw price index and quantities data is publicly available 
      at the BEA's website. However, I was able to gain access to an intermediate dataset that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland uses
      to create their <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/median-pce-inflation">Median PCE Inflation</a> bank product. This is the same 
      data as the BEA, just in an easier format to use. With the data in a digestable format, the data cleaning was not all that difficult. The more arduous
      task was to narrow down which data in specific to use to answer the question "Which Goods and Services Drove Inflation During COVID-19?". I ultimately decided
      to tell a story of ***. My first chart sets up the story that each good or service in PCE may have wildly different price changes in any given month. The second
      chart looks at the most volatile goods during the COVID-19 period and how their price changes vary considerably. The last chart then ***. Since the data was pretty 
      encompassing, and easy to access, the only real limitation I came across was attempting a D3.js figure that is maybe more complicated than my current skillset.
