    <h1>Which Goods and Services Drove Inflation During COVID-19?</h1>
    <h2>A peak into PCE inflation goods and services during the pandemic</h2>
    <p>
      The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic threw our way of life into a panic. The manner in which we lived seemingly changed 
      overnight. The mass closures for the good of public health lead to a short, but deep recession, one of the largest shocks to our economy 
      in history led to price pressures that have not been seen in decades. Inflation went from a topic only discussed by academics 
      and policymakers to being on the forefront of public debate. Consumers now find themselves painfully aware of inflation. 
      A fair question to ask would be "which of the goods and services have been driving the high levels of inflation"? This project aims to shed a little light on that quesiton.

    <h3>Look into Price Change Distribution</h3>

      Among the 201 goods and services that are used to compute PCE inflation, we see price changes vary widely during the COVID-19 period.
      It is noteworthy that the very bottom and top of the distribution are considerably distant from the average and median percent change 
      in prices. Everything in the IQR (25th to 75th percentiles) is relatively clustered, and consistent.

    <h3>How much did some of the most volatile components change during COVID-19?</h3>

      The charts above look at five of the most volatile goods in the PCE price index during the COVID-19 period. This sets out to show how big the
      largest deviation from February 2020 price levels were (the outermost circle), and what the current price is in relation to the pre-COVID period (the middle circle).
      Although each of these goods are the most volatile in terms of price changes, the nature of those changes are quite different. Gasoline, and
      other fuel/oils behaved in a predictable pattern. Peaking in price during only to come down, but not to pre-COVID levels. Film/photo supplies
      and primary school lunches took a different shape, however. The pandemic caused a rapid decrease in prices for consumers for both goods 
      (the school lunches have an intuitive answer as to why, many free-lunch programs were instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, causing
      consumer spending on school lunches to drop).

    <h3>COVID-19 led to massive price swings</h3>

      This variable area chart shows the 10 most volatile goods and services during the COVID-19 period. The thickness of the line denotes the weighted-price
      index for the good, with the lines towards the top denoting the goods with the higher index value (February 2020=100). It can be seen that the initial 
      wave of COVID-19 (2020) led to rapid swings in the prices of these goods. However, by mid-2021, the change in the price indices smoothed out, although 
      many at the top (energy goods in particular) have continue to grow in their index value.
