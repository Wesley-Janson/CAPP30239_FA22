    <h1>Which Goods and Services Drove Inflation During COVID-19?</h1>
    <h2>A peak into PCE inflation goods and services during the pandemic</h2>
    <p>
      The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic threw our way of life into a panic. The manner in which we lived seemingly changed 
      overnight. The mass closures for the good of public health lead to a short, but deep recession, one of the largest shocks to our economy 
      in history led to price pressures that have not been seen in decades. Inflation went from a topic only discussed by academics 
      and policymakers to being on the forefront of public ***. Consumers now ***. A fair question to ask would be "which of the goods 
      and services have been driving the high levels of inflation"? This project aims to shed a little light on that quesiton.

    <p>
      Among the 201 goods and services that are used to compute PCE inflation, we see price changes vary widely during the COVID-19 period.
      *** but are mostly on the tails of the distribution. Everything in the IQR (25th to 75th percentiles) is relatively clustered, and consistent.
