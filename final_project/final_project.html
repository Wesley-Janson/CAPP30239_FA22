    <h1>US Guns Deaths at the Hands of Police Officers</h1>
    <h2>What age are victims?</h2>
    <p>
      These graphs set out to provide some information regarding police-perpetrated deaths in the United States in 2015, 
      and uses data from the a3cleanedonly2015.json file.

    <p>
      This graph above shows the distribution of the ages of the victims of police gun violence. We see results that one would 
      expect: those between 20-50 years old are most commonly killed. However, some stark (and incredibly sad) findings are 
      shown-one person under the age of 10, and numerous senior citizens were killed by police officers.
