    <h1>Which Goods and Services Drove Inflation During COVID-19?</h1>
    <h2>A peek into PCE inflation goods and services during the pandemic</h2>
    <p>
      The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic threw our way of life into a panic. The manner in which we lived seemingly changed 
      overnight. The mass closures for the good of public health led to a short, but deep recession, one of the largest shocks to our economy 
      in history led to price pressures that have not been seen in decades. Inflation went from a topic only discussed by academics 
      and policymakers to being on the forefront of public debate. Consumers now find themselves painfully aware of inflation. 
      A fair question to ask would be "which of the goods and services have been driving the high levels of inflation"? This project aims to shed 
      a little light on that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a step back-what is inflation? Why is this question important to us? Inflation can be characterized as the general increase in the overall price level 
      of the goods and services in the economy (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14419.htm#:~:text=Inflation%20is%20the%20increase%20in,and%20services%20in%20the%20economy.">Federal Reserve</a>). 
      It's importance to our day-to-day lives cannot be understated. Inflation affects the purchasing power that people have 
      first and foremost, but also has been shown to be a key indicator in both expected and realized economic performance. Specific to this project, the 
      measure of inflation I use is the Bureau of Economic Analysis' (BEA) Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE). This is the measure targeted 
      by the Federal Reserve in the United States and is "A measure of the prices that people living in the United States, or those buying on their behalf, 
      pay for goods and services" (<a href="https://www.bea.gov/resources/learning-center/what-to-know-prices-inflation">BEA</a>). 
    </p>
    <p>
      PCE inflation uses 201 goods and services to approximate the general change in price level for consumers. Each month, a representative 
      sample of consumers are surveyed about what they purchase, both the price and quantity. The BEA then tabulates each goods price and quantity for consumers. 
      To compute the reported "headline" inflation rate, the expenditure weighted average (as determined by the quantities) of the price changes is computed. Similarly,
      different baskets can be computed ("core" inflation is a commonly reported one-all goods less energy and food items). These aggregate metrics can be a good indicator
      of the general trend in prices but may obfuscate underlying trends in specific goods. It was with that in mind that I set out to explore the components that make up 
      PCE inflation, and how their prices and weights have changed during COVID-19. 
    <h3>Look into Price Change Distribution</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      Among all the goods and services that are used to compute PCE inflation, we see the price changes vary widely during the COVID-19 period.
      It is noteworthy that the very bottom and top of the distribution are considerably distant from the average and median percent change 
      in prices. However, everything between the 25th and 75th percentiles are relatively stable and consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A question that a reasonable person could ask is: if we are taking the average of the price changes to create the inflation rate, shouldn't these extreme percentiles greatly effect it?
      While on the right path in recognizing that averages are susceptible to outliers, it is the expenditure weights that go into the creation of inflation that largely prevent
      these outlier components from pulling the inflation measure one way or another. But what happens when these high-weight goods change dramatically? The short answer: the inflation measure
      follows suit. The next section shows how our current inflationary episode is being influenced by the highest weighted components.

    <h3>COVID-19 led to massive price swings in the highest weighted goods</h3>

      This variable area chart shows the 10 highest weighted goods on average during the COVID-19 period. The thickness of the line denotes the weighted-price
      index for the good, with the lines towards the top denoting the goods with the higher index value (February 2020=100). The initial 
      wave of COVID-19 (2020) led to rapid swings in the prices of these goods. However, by mid-2021, the change in the price indices smoothed out, although 
      many at the top (energy goods in particular) continued to grow in their index value, which can be seen by the growing width of the top few lines. Only recently 
      have the prices in the energy sector started to cool off but remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
    </p>
    <h3>How much did some of the most volatile components change during COVID-19?</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      The charts above look at five of the most volatile goods and services in terms of monthly price changes in the PCE price index during the COVID-19 period. 
      This illustrates just how extreme the largest deviation from February 2020 price levels were (marked "Max Deviation"), and what the current price is in 
      relation to the pre-COVID period ("Current"). Although each of these goods are the most volatile in terms of price changes, the nature of those changes is 
      quite different. Gasoline, and other fuel/oil behaved in a predictable pattern. Peaking in price during 2021 only to come down, but not to pre-COVID levels. Film/photo supplies
      and primary school lunches took a different shape, however. The pandemic caused a rapid decrease in prices for consumers for both goods 
      (the school lunches have an intuitive answer as to why, many free-lunch programs were instituted at the beginning of the pandemic, causing
      consumer spending on school lunches to drop).

    <h3>Data Process</h3>
    <p>
      This topic was of interest to me due to my research background on the topic. Before entering the CAPP program, I was a Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
      where I predominantly researched topics related to inflation dynamics and expectations. For most of my time there, the topic of inflation was not one of particular public interest
      in the U.S., as price levels had been relatively calm for close to four decades. With the onset of COVID-19, that changed. The initial shock to the economy was then followed by levels
      of inflation not seen in the U.S. since the early 1980s. With the topic now much more of interest to the general public, I thought using some of my previous knowledge could lead to an
      interesting project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process for gathering the relevant price and weights data was a relatively simple one. The raw price index and quantities data is publicly available 
      at the BEA's website. However, I was able to gain access to an intermediate dataset that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland uses
      to create their <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/median-pce-inflation">Median PCE Inflation</a> bank product. This is the same 
      data as the BEA, just in an easier format to use. With the data in a digestible format, the data cleaning was not all that difficult. The more arduous
      task was to narrow down which data in specific to use to answer the question "which goods and services drove inflation during COVID-19?". I decided the 
      narrative I wanted to tell was that there are two main inputs into inflation: prices and weights. Understanding how these two interact is paramount in answering the 
      question posed in the title of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first chart sets up the story that each good or service in PCE may have wildly different price changes in any given month. But as I mention, simply observing the price 
      changes without accounting for the weights is quite deceptive. If one good has a price change 10 percentage points higher than the average that certainly is of note, but 
      if it comprisises just a small portion of the "basket" of goods, its overall importance to inflation is quite negligible. The idea of the importance of weights leads me to 
      my second chart, which looks at the highest weighted goods seen during the COVID-19 period (as determined by average monthly weight from March 2020-September 2022), and 
      look at how their price change patterns developed over time. This visual was designed to allow one to easily see how at one point during the pandemic, the highest weighted
      (in some respects, most important) goods saw extreme price changes in relation to pre-COVID levels, and though now are less extreme, still have not yet returned to February 2020 levels.
      In juxtaposition to weights, my last chart emphasizes the large changes in prices during the COVID-19 period. By taking the 10 goods with the highest volatility in price from March 2020-September 2022
      (as defined by their variance), I can see the extent to which the global pandemic, and the ensuing supply chain issues had. One noteworthy observation, there is a bit
      of overlap between the goods that appear in the second and third figures. <i>These</i> are the exact goods that should receive attention-goods that are relatively large purchases for
      consumers that experienced large price swings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the data was pretty encompassing, and easy to access, the only real limitation I came across was attempting a D3.js figure that is maybe more complicated than my current skillset allows for.
