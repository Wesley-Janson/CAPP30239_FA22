    <h1>US Guns Deaths at the Hands of Police Officers</h1>
    <h2>What age are victims?</h2>
    <p>
      These graphs set out to provide some information regarding police-perpetrated deaths in the United States in 2015, 
      and uses data from the a3cleanedonly2015.json file.
    </p>
    <div id="hist-chart"></div>
    <p>
      This graph above shows the distribution of the ages of the victims of police gun violence. We see results that one would 
      expect: those between 20-50 years old are most commonly killed. However, some stark (and incredibly sad) findings are 
      shown-one person under the age of 10, and numerous senior citizens were killed by police officers.
    </p>

  <div id="container">
    <h2>What race are victims?</h2>
    <div id="donut-chart"></div>
    <p>
      This second graph is a good example of how aggregate statistics without context can be very misleading. In aggregate, 
      white people are the victims of police gun violence the most often; however, per capita statistics would be a better comparison.

    <h2>Dispelling the myth of public safety issues</h2>
    <div id="stack-chart"></div>
    <p>
      This last graph sets out to dispel the myth that those who die at the hands of police officers are either i) suffering from mental
      distress or ii) fleeing from police, leading to a public safety issue. You can see that by and large, neither statements have any 
      truth. A large majority (91%) are not fleeing or suffering from a mental health issue (79%). All of that said, neither of those
      conditions alone justify the police taking their life.
