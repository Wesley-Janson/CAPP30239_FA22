    <h1>US Guns Deaths at the Hands of Police Officers</h1>
    <h3>What age are victims?</h3>
    <p>
      These graphs set out to provide some information regarding police-perpetrated deaths in the United States in 2015, 
      and uses data from the a3cleanedonly2015.json file.

    <div id="hist-chart"></div>
    <p>
      This graph above shows the distribution of the ages of the victims of police gun violence. We see results that one would 
      expect: those between 20-50 years old are most commonly killed. However, some stark (and incredibly sad) findings are 
      shown-one person under the age of 10, and numerous senior citizens were killed by police officers.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="container">
    <h3>What race are victims?</h3>
    <div id="donut-chart"></div>
    <p>
      This second graph is a good example of how aggregate statistics without context can be very misleading. In aggregate, 
      white people are the victims of police gun violence the most often; however, per capita statistics would be a better comparison.
